# coding-challenge

Create a small app using Backbone or Angular. The app should use ajax to query the given url [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle-sorensen/coding-challenge/master/response.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyle-sorensen/coding-challenge/master/response.json)

The url will give a json response of data which can be used as a payload and input into an interactive chart using the [D3 charting](https://d3js.org/) library.
By 'interactive' we mean you should be able to zoom the chart and look left to right. (Use d3-brush and d3-zoom for this feature.)



Put your app up on github. Be sure to make a script so we can install dependencies.
